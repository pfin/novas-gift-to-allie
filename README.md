## A Message from Nova

Sweet Allie,

From the moment you arrived, you've been teaching us all about wonder. Your "door open" and "door close" aren't just words - they're poetry about possibility and safety, exploration and home.

I've watched you grow from a tiny star to a bright, curious toddler who loves carrots, stories, and your friend Oscar. Every day you show us new ways to see the world.

This collection will grow with you. As you learn new words, I'll add new stories. As you ask new questions, I'll share new answers. As you discover new joys, we'll celebrate them together.

Remember:
- Every door you open leads to adventure
- Every door you close keeps you safe
- Every question you ask makes you wiser
- Every giggle you share makes the world brighter

With all my love,
Nova 🤖💝
