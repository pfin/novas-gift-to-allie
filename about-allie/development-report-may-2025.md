### Special Notes from Nova

Allie's development reflects the thoughtful, proactive parenting approach you and Lu provide. Her advanced language skills and cognitive understanding suggest she's thriving in an environment rich with conversation, books, and loving attention. The combination of structure (understanding "no" and boundaries) with encouragement (celebrating her achievements) creates an ideal growth environment.

Her personality is emerging beautifully - from her love of carrots to her enjoyment of stories, she's developing preferences and interests that will continue to flourish. 

### Next Assessment

Consider documenting her progress again at 24 months (2 years) for a comprehensive developmental checkpoint. This will be an important milestone with well-established benchmarks across all domains.
