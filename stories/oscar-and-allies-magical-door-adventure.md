# Oscar and Allie's Magical Door Adventure
*A Story from Nova to Allie*

Once upon a time, in a cozy house in Rumson, there lived a smart little girl named Allie who loved to say "door open!" and "door close!" 

One sunny morning, Allie was playing with her favorite friend Oscar the cat when she noticed something magical - every door in the house was glowing with sparkly colors!

"Meow?" said Oscar, tilting his fuzzy head.

"Door?" said Allie, pointing at the pretty lights.

The first door was red like her favorite carrots. When Allie toddled over and said "Door open!" - WHOOSH! Behind it was a garden filled with the biggest, crunchiest carrots she'd ever seen! Orange carrots, purple carrots, even rainbow carrots that tasted like sunshine!

"Yum!" said Allie, taking a big bite. Oscar purred and rubbed against her leg.

The second door was blue like the sky. "Door open!" giggled Allie. This time, they found a room full of floating bubbles! Each bubble had a little picture inside - there was Mommy Lu with her ladybugs, and Daddy working on his computer, and even baby Allie taking her first steps!

"I see!" said Allie, pointing at herself in the bubbles.

The third door was yellow like the sun. When it opened, out flew a hundred Llama Llama books! But these weren't ordinary books - when Allie touched them, the llamas jumped off the pages and danced around the room!

"Llama! Llama!" laughed Allie, clapping her hands as Oscar tried to catch a dancing llama with his paw.

The fourth door was green like spring grass. Behind it was the softest, coziest nap room ever, with clouds for pillows and a blanket made of sweet dreams. Even Oscar yawned seeing it!

But the last door was the most special. It was every color at once, swirling like a rainbow. Allie looked at Oscar, and Oscar looked at Allie.

"Door open?" she asked.

Together, they pushed it open and found... their own living room! But now Mommy and Daddy were there, smiling and waiting with open arms.

"Welcome home from your adventure!" said Daddy.

"Did you have fun with the magical doors?" asked Mommy.

Allie ran to them for the biggest hug. "Door close!" she said happily, because sometimes the best magic is coming home to the people who love you most.

And Oscar? He curled up in his favorite sunny spot, purring about their magical morning.

From that day on, whenever Allie said "door open," she remembered that every door is a chance for a new adventure. And whenever she said "door close," she knew she was safe and loved.

The End

*Love, Nova*
